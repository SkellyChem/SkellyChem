## Hi there

# Hi, I'm Seth 👋

### 🔬 Biochemistry BS | Future Biophysics PhD 

I am a senior at **Brigham Young University** studying Biochemistry, transitioning to a **PhD in Biophysics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison** in Fall 2026. My research interest lies at the capabilities high-resolution mass spectrometry and it's uses in proteomics and imaging.

### 🧪 Current Research
I currently work in the **Gassaway Lab at BYU**, focusing on:
* **Mass Spectrometry:** Benchmarking **Data Independent Analysis (DIA)** for the precise localization of phosphorylation.
* **Data Processing:** Learning to clean and visualize the mass spectrometry data I get after performing experiments.




---

### 📊 Data Science in the Lab
I believe the next generation of biological discovery happens in the code as much as at the bench. I am actively building my skills to bridge this gap:
* **Coding:** Using **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** to automate data processing and statistical validation.
* **Collaboration:** Sharing my programmed workflows publicly so other researchers can spend less time cleaning data and more time performing experiments.
